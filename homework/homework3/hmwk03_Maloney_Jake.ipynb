Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

Every time a boat passes under the bridge, cars must stop while the bridge is raised to accommodate the height of the boat.  As both boat and car traffic increases, city planners are considering building a new taller bridge that will never impede the flow of traffic. As part of a larger simulation of traffic congestion, you need to decide how to model the arrival of boats at the bridge.  From your Intro to Data Science class you remember that the time _between_ independent arrivals are usually modeled by an Exponential distribution.  Finally, you have access to a report that says on average 10 boats cross under the bridge per day.\n",

Bludger Bob charges a fee of \\$100 per game, but as a testament to his confidence in his abilities, only charges you the \\$100 for games that you win and only if you win the series.  So, if you play a 11-game series and win you will take home \\$10,000 less \\$600 for Bludger Bob's fees, for a total payout of \\$9,400.  What is the expected payout for an 11-game series?   "
